> 这是十五篇毕业演讲中给我触动最多。最有哲学的一篇，作者David Foster Wallace是美国的长篇小说，短篇小说和散文作家，又是英语和创意写作的教授。

# 特将其摘录如下

Greetings,thanks,and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005.There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes "What the hell is water?" 

This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story ["thing"] turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don't be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning. 
在美国，典礼开幕演讲都有一个惯例，那就是一个像上面这样的，有点教条的小寓言。这类小故事无疑为这种又臭又长的演讲方式增添了一抹亮色，但你们要是担心我在接下来的时间里，会借着这个寓言把自己包装成一条智慧的大鱼，再给你们这些小鱼详细解释什么叫水，那你们就可以放宽心了，我没这个打算。我不是智慧的大鱼。我讲这个鱼的故事只是想说明，那些最明白重要的事实，常常是那些最难被关注和讨论的。你看，我这么一讲，这句话就变得不过是陈腐的老生常谈了，但事实上，在那些日复一日的，漫长的成年人生活里，这种陈腐的老生常谈其实起到了举足轻重的重要性。至少在这个干燥清爽的早晨，我希望你们能把我这句话放在心里听我讲。

Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I'm supposed to talk about your liberal arts education's meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let's talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about quote teaching you how to think. If you're like me as a student, you've never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I'm going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we're supposed to get in a place like this isn't really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I'd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious. 
说起来，当然，像我今天这样的演讲的一个很重要的目的，就是谈论你们的通识教育的意义为何，就是为了解释清楚为什么你们即将获得的学位真的有其实际价值所在，而不仅仅是对你们长时间辛苦的报酬。所以我们不妨先从那些最举世皆知的陈词滥调开始谈起。也就是那句经典的，通识教育的意义不在于灌输知识，而在于“教会你如何思考”。如果你跟学生时代的我一样，你肯定不喜欢听到这句话，说不定还会感到被侮辱了，因为这说得好像你非得找个人来教你才会思考一样。但是我今天想要向你解释，这句陈词滥调并不是用来侮辱你的，因为我们所说的“教育会教会你思考”，并不是说有了教育你才能思考，而是教育使你懂得应该思考什么。如果你感觉这种说法很浪费时间，如果你相信你可以自由地思考一切事情，那我建议你想一下那个关于鱼和水的故事，并且暂时先把你对万事万物的怀疑论放到一边。

Here's another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: "Look, it's not like I don't have actual reasons for not believing in God. It's not like I haven't ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn't see a thing, and it was fifty below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out 'Oh, God, if there is a God, I'm lost in this blizzard, and I'm gonna die if you don't help me.'" And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. "Well then you must believe now," he says, "After all, here you are, alive." The atheist just rolls his eyes. "No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp." 
让我再讲一个教条的小故事吧。在阿拉斯加的荒野上有两个人坐在酒吧里，其中一个信基督教，而另一个是无神论者。他们借着四大杯啤酒的劲开始争执上帝是否存在。无神论者说：“你看，我并不是没有理由地拒绝上帝的。我又不是没见识过那些上帝啊祷告啊一类的事情。上个月我在营地外遇到了一场暴风雪，迷路了，什么都看不见，当时只有零下50度。所以我试着跪在雪地里大喊：‘啊，上帝啊，我现在在暴风雪里迷路了，你要是存在，就救救我，不然我就死定了。’”然后在酒吧里，那个基督徒疑惑地看着无神论者。“好吧，那你现在该相信上帝了啊，”他说，“不管怎样，你现在不是活下来了吗？”无神论者翻了个白眼。“哦不，伙计。过来把我救回营地的的只是两个路过的爱斯基摩人罢了。”

It's easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people's two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy's interpretation is true and the other guy's is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person's most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there's the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They're probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists' problem is exactly the same as the story's unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up. 
我们也可以把这个故事化成一句通识教育里的陈词滥调：在拥有不同的信仰和不同的思考方式的人眼中，同样的经历可以有完全不同的意义。因为我们重视信仰的包容和多样性，所以我们的通识教育从不断言某人的解释是对的，或者另一个人的是错的、坏的。这是件好事，但是我们还是没办法停止讨论这些信仰和思考方式到底从何而来。我们说这些观念来自那两个人本身。也就是说，一个人对世界和他的经历抱有的，最最基本的态度，常常就像身高和鞋码那样早已被根植不变；或者，就像语言那样直接来源于他的文化习俗。也就是说，那些世界观不曾经过他自己有意识的选择。这样还造成了一种绝对化的狂妄自大。那个无神论者是如此确定于他的观念，以至于他根本不相信那两个路过的爱斯基摩人和他自己的求助祈祷有任何关联。同样也有很多有神论者如此坚信着他们对于事情的自己的看法。我们当中的大多数可能都会觉得他们比无神论者更讨厌，但坚定的有神论者和这故事里的无神论者其实有一样的问题：一种盲目的坚信。这种坚信铸成的监牢是如此的彻底，以至于囚徒根本感觉不到自己被锁住了。

The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too. 
我认为这才是那句“通识教育教会我们如何思考”的精髓之一所在。它教会我们不要那么狂妄自大，对自己和自己坚信的东西有那么一些批判的意识。因为我们下意识地相信的东西里面可能有很大一部分其实是错的。我本人是历经辛苦才学到这一点的，而我猜你们这些毕业生最后可能也得走我的路。

Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the realist, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centeredness because it's so socially repulsive. But it's pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people's thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real. 
我来举个例子，说一件我总是下意识坚信的错事吧：我人生里所有的经历都证实着我的一个坚定的信念，那就是，我，是宇宙百分百的中心；是全世界最鲜活、最重要的人物。我们很少去思考这种自然而基本的自我中心论，因为这听起来太欠揍了。但我们都是这么想的。这是我们的系统默认思考方式，从出生开始就根植在我们的脑子里。你想想：我们所有的经历都是以我们自己为中心的。你眼中的事物，总是在你的面前，你的背后，你的左边或者右边，在你的电视上或者你的主机里，诸如此类。其他人的思想可以传递到你那里，但只有你自己是如此的鲜活、真实、瞬息万变。

Please don't worry that I'm getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It's a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being "well-adjusted", which I suggest to you is not an accidental term. 
别担心，我说这些并不是打算向你们灌输那些体恤他人啊，善解人意啊一类的美德。这毫不关系到美德。这关系到的是选择，选择去改变和解放我们那些与生俱来，根植不变的系统默认思考方式，那种无比自我中心，以自我作为滤镜观看解释一切事物的习惯，哪怕只有一点点。那些可以如此调整自己的人常常被我们称为“适应性强”的人，而我认为这种称呼不是偶然的。

Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education -- least in my own case -- is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me. 
那么现在，考虑到贵校卓越的学术成就，以下这个问题就明显起来：我说的这种调整默认思考方式的行为，有多大程度取决于人的智慧和学识？这个问题有点刁。教育对人最危险的影响——至少对我而言——就是让我总是把事情想得太学术太复杂，迷失于自己脑中那些抽象的理论概念，而不是单纯关注那些真是发生在我面前和我心中的事。

As I'm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master. 
我相信你们应该都知道，想要时刻保持清醒和细致是很难的，而把自己沉浸在脑海里那些没完没了的独白要容易得多（也许它现在就响在你脑子里）。当我毕业二十年后，我才渐渐明白通识教育那句“教会你如何思考”的陈词滥调的背后，其实隐含着一个更深刻严肃的道理：学会如何思考，其实是意味着能够在某种程度上控制自己思考什么，怎么思考。这意味着要时刻保持足够清醒，时刻选择应该关注什么，以及应该如何从自己的经历中提取意义。因为如果你在成人生活中不善于做这种选择，你将会很痛苦。正如一句俗话所说，“智慧是优秀的仆人，但却是差劲的主人”。

This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger. 
这句话和大部分俗话一样表面上又乏味又无趣，但却揭示了一个恐怖的真理。人们用枪自杀的时候总是向头部开枪，这不是一个偶然。他们想杀死那个差劲的主人。而且事实上，大部分自杀者在扣动扳机之前好久，其实已经死了。

And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let's get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what "day in day out" really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I'm talking about. 
而我觉得，你们所接受的通识教育，其童叟无欺的价值也便在此：如何让你那平安，富足，受人尊敬的人生免于无知无觉的死亡，免于沦为你的头脑和你的默认价值观的奴隶，免于在那种独一无二，彻彻底底的孤独中过着日子。这听起来又夸张又扯淡，所以我讲具体一点吧。具体一点就是，你们这些应届毕业生不会真的懂得所谓的“过日子”到底是什么。这几乎包括了美国成人生活的全部时光，但却没人在毕业典礼演说上讨论它。这部分的生活里包括了很多的了无生趣，一成不变和琐碎的烦躁。在座的家长和年长些的听众都会十分清楚我在说些什么。

By way of example, let's say it's an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you're tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there's no food at home. You haven't had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It's the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it's pretty much the last place you want to be but you can't just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store's confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren't enough check-out lanes open even though it's the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can't take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college. 
让我们来假设，这是你成人生活的一个平平常常的日子。你大清早起床，奔赴你毕业后拿到的那份很难搞的白领工作，在那里奋斗八到十个小时，下班后无比疲惫还有点压抑。你什么都不想，只想赶快回家吃顿好的，放松一会，然后早点扑到床上去，因为你第二天早上肯定还得起来，再把这堆事儿应付一遍。但是这时候你突然想起来家里没吃的了。你这周还没来得及去买东西，因为你那份工作很难搞，所以现在下班后你还得钻进车里开到超市去。下班高峰期的交通状况可想而知：差到极点。所以前往超市花了老长老长的时间，而进了超市，还是人挤人，因为其他那些同样有难搞的工作的家伙，现在也在疯狂挤进超市，想要买晚饭。超市一片混乱，充斥着傻到死的背景音乐，这是全世界你最不想来的地方，但你还不能迅速买完就走；你必须得走过那些五颜六色，迷宫似的过道去找到你想要的东西，再想方设法把你塞得满满的购物车挤过其他那些疲倦匆忙的推车的人类（以下省略数千字，因为这的确是一场超级车轮战）。最后你终于找到了所有的晚餐素材，但你现在发现结账柜台的数量根本应付不了这么多人的突击。柜台前的排队长到恐怖，而你感到自己像个傻逼。但你还不能将你的烦闷发泄到你面前的那个疯狂的女收银员身上，因为她加班奋战的这份工作，其无意义、无生趣的程度更不是我们这些名校出身的人能够想象的。

But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line's front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to "Have a nice day" in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera. 
但不管怎么样你还是排完队，结完帐了，还得到一句用死人般的声音说出来的“祝您愉快”。然后你就得把那堆笨重鼓胀的超市塑料袋拖进你的购物车，车的一个轮子还抽风似的直往左转。你推着它走过那拥挤、崎岖、肮脏的停车场，然后开车回家，没入那条又慢又堵的高峰期车流，诸如此类。

Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn't yet been part of you graduates' actual life routine, day after week after month after year. 
当然了，在座的每个人都经历过这种事。但它还没有成为你们这些毕业生的生活的一部分，日复一日，周复一周，月复一月，年复一年。

But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it's going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is. 
但它会的，连同更多如此无趣、烦人、并且没有一点意义的日常工作，来成为你们生活的一部分。但我想展现给你们的不是这个事实。我想告诉你们的是，正是在这样琐碎、烦人的日常之中，才需要我前面说的那些“选择”。因为那些高峰期车流、拥堵的过道和漫长的排队给了我思考的时间，而我如果不有意识地去决定自己如何思考、思考什么，我就会在每一次购物中不断地抓狂和烦躁。因为在我天生的默认思考方式之下，我看这类的事情只能想到我自己，想到我自己有多饿，有多累，有多想回家，我就会觉得好像全世界的人都在挡我的道似的。而那都是群什么人啊？我会想到他们一个比一个讨厌，那些排队的人都是瞪着死鱼眼的傻逼，比起人类更像牲口，而那些在队伍中间大声讲电话的家伙都是多么的没有教养。我会想到这一切对我是多么不公平。

Or, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV's and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, forty-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper- stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest (responding here to loud applause this is an example of how NOT to think, though) most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the future's fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on. 
又或者，如果我的默认思考方式更接近通识教育里的那些关心社会的知识分子，我可以在车流中痛骂那些笨重、挡道、自私自利、以40加仑大油箱浪费资源的SUV、悍马和V-12型货车。我可以思考为什么那些在车后保险杠上贴爱国和宗教标语的人却往往开着最大号，最自私浪费的车，在路上还特别蛮横。我还可以想想我们的子孙后代会不会恨我们这些家伙，因为我们浪费了未来所有的燃料，还搞坏了环境。我可以觉得我们全都是一帮被惯坏了的自私的傻逼，或者现代社会的消费主义非常差劲，诸如此类。你大概懂我的意思。
You get the idea. 

If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn't have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It's the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of 
adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world's priorities. 
如果你选择在超市里或者公路上这么想，完全没问题。我们很多人都这么干。以这种方式思考看起来是如此的简单自然，以至于这看起来根本没什么值得再去选择的。这是我的天生系统默认值。这是我在经历人生这一段枯燥繁琐拥挤的时光的时候，自然而然毫无意识的思考方式，因为我认为我是世界的中心，而我的需求和感受是判定这个世界的最高标准。

The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it's not impossible that some of these people in SUV's have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way. 
但是问题就在于，当然，关于这类经历，世界上还存在着截然不同的思考方式。在高峰期的大堵塞中，在这堆停在我面前挡着我的路的车流之中，也许有些SUV的司机以前曾经历过惨痛的车祸，他们对道路的心理阴影太深了，只有呆在巨大笨重的SUV里才能有安全感。又或者刚才那个变道插我队的悍马里面坐着一位父亲和他受伤或者生病了的孩子，而他想要飞速赶到医院。他的急迫比我更有道理：是我在挡他的道，不是他挡我的。

Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do. 
又或者我可以让我自己想，也许和我一起在超市排队的那些人其实个个都像我一样厌倦烦躁，也许有些的生活比我的更乏味痛苦。

Again, please don't think that I'm giving you moral advice, or that I'm saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it's hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won't be able to do it, or you just flat out won't want to. 
和上次一样，请别觉得我是在对你进行道德劝导，或者觉得我是在要求你也这么想，或者觉得我是在指责你无动于衷。因为这么想很难。这么想需要意志力和努力。像我，有些时候我就做不到，或者你也可以说，我就是不想这么做。

But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she's not usually like this. Maybe she's been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low- wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it's also not impossible. It just depends what you what to consider. If you're automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down. 
但是大部分时候，如果你能意识到这一点，并给自己一个选择如何思考的机会，你会对那个正在对孩子怒吼的死鱼眼的黄脸肥婆的看法有一点改观。也许她不是一直如此。也许她在这之前熬了整整三个晚上去陪伴她因为骨癌而垂死的丈夫。或者也许她其实是那个昨天对你的爱人小小地法外开恩了一下的交通局的小职员，她帮你免除了好多政府部门的繁文缛节。好吧，这些可能性看起来很低，但它们并不是零。这仅仅取决于你从什么角度看这件事。如果你自然而然地相信你对现实了若指掌，自然而然地用系统默认的方式思考，你就可能会像我一样，没能考虑那些不那么讨厌烦人的可能性。但是如果你学会了如何去思考，你就会明白思考的选择不止这一个。你可以选择从一个拥挤、炎热、龟速的地狱里看出一些内涵，甚至有点神圣的东西：爱，友谊，还有我们心底的真善美。

Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it. This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to worship. 
那些心底的美好并不一定是真的。唯一货真价实的只有你自己做出的选择，选择如何看待一件事。
我认为教育给予人的真正的自由就在于此，在于教会人“调整自己”。你可以有意识地决定什么有意义，什么没有。你可以决定你的信仰。

Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. 
因为这里有一个诡异的事实：在我们日复一日、长之又长的成人生活里，没有人是真正的无神论者。没有人什么都不信仰。每个人都有信仰。我们只能选择到底信仰什么。而也许，选择信仰某种神灵或者精神——不管是耶稣，安拉，耶和华，地母神，四圣谛还是什么其他不可逾越的道德准则——而不是选择信仰其他东西，其最难以辩驳的好处就是，你信仰的其他东西，都很有可能就是那个把你活生生吃掉的东西。如果你信仰金钱和物质，如果你把它们当成人生的终极意义，那你永远都不会停手，永远都不会感觉已经满足。这是事实。信仰你的身体，美貌和性吸引力，你就会永远感觉自己丑不可及。当时间流逝，你开始衰老，你就恨不得自己早死一万次来逃避这种痛苦。某种意义上，我们都已经很明白这些道理了。它们被铭刻在各种神话，俗语，警句，比喻上，是各种寓言故事的主题。唯一麻烦的就是得时刻意识到这个事实。

Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings. 
信仰力量，你最后就会不停地感到脆弱和害怕，你就得渴求更多控制他人的力量来摆脱你自己的恐惧。信仰你的智力，做一个聪明人，你最后就会不停地感到自己是个白痴，是个假货，随时可能被揭穿。但这些信仰最阴险的地方不在于它们是邪恶的，而在于它们是无意识的。它们是默认值。

They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing. 
它们是那种你日复一日慢慢陷进去的信仰，让你对你的目之所见和价值观念越来越挑剔，而你根本不会意识到你到底在做什么。

And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and [unintelligible -- sounds like "displayal"]. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day. 
而且我们的现实世界并不会阻止我们用默认方式思考，因为我们这个金钱权力至上的人类社会本身就在一个充满了恐惧，愤怒，挫败，渴望和自我崇拜的池子里狂欢。我们的当今社会正是借助这些力量才产出了惊人的财富、舒适和个人自由。这自由就是我们能君临我们头盖骨里的微型王宫里，成为万物的中心。这种自由有很多可提倡之处。但当然这世上还有很多不同类型的自由，而其中最宝贵的一种自由，你可能很难在外面那个奋斗和渴望的世界听到。这种重要的自由需要专注，意识和自制，需要真正关心其他的人，愿意为他们每天以，千千万万种琐碎、不性感的方式，牺牲一遍又一遍。

That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing. 
这就是真正的自由。这就是教养，和学会如何思考。另一种选择是麻木，采用默认思考方式，像轮子里的小白鼠一样每天被得得失失的来回挠着小心脏，永无宁日。

I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don't just dismiss it as just some finger- wagging Dr. Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death. 
我知道我说的这些东西不像毕业典礼演讲该有的样子，一点都不好玩，不愉快，也不醍醐灌顶。我说的东西，在我看来，剥光那些华丽微妙的辞藻，只是在讲所谓的“真实”。你们呢，当然，可以想怎么认为就怎么认为。但是请不要就把我的话当成一个老学究摇摇手指扯出的陈词滥调。我说的没有一个字和道德啊，宗教啊，传统啊，或者超脱生死的问题啊一类的有关系。

The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death. 
所谓的真实，只存在于尚未死亡的生活里。

It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over: 
"This is water." "This is water." 
这就是真正的教育带来的真正的意义，基本上与知识毫无关系，只是关系到简单的意识；意识到什么是最真实重要的，什么一直隐藏在青天白日之下，以至于我们必须得时时刻刻一遍一遍提醒自己：

“这就是水。”“这就是水。”

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now. 
要做到这点，要保证自己在成人世界里永远清醒而鲜活地过日子，超乎想象地困难。这也就刚好应了另一个陈词滥调：“教育是一生的事。”而它，从现在开始

I wish you way more than luck.
